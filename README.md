# xled-js

An API to control [Twinkly](https://twinkly.com) smart lights.  
A re-imagining of [TwinklyController](https://github.com/i-am-gizm0/TwinklyController), inspired by [xled](https://github.com/scrool/xled), written in Typescript, based on the [unofficial xled api docs](https://xled-docs.readthedocs.io).
